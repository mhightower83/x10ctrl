# DRAFT
## A simple Web App based remote control for the ha-bridge
At this time there is only *On* and *Off* functions. A *Dimmer* control has not yet been implemented.
### Setup
* Place the files `remote.htm` and `manifest.json` on the same web server you have ha-bridge running through.
   * The files will usually go in directory: `/var/www/html`.
   
   ```
   cd /var/www/html
   sudo wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhightower83/x10ctrl/master/src/www/remote.htm"
   sudo wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhightower83/x10ctrl/master/src/www/manifest.json"
   ```
   * If the files are not placed at the root of your server path you will need to update the files `remote.htm` and `manifest.json` internal references to each other, such that they internally point to the new locations.
* To use from the Chrome browser on a smart phone, access remote.htm on the server.
   * eg. `http://hapi/remote.htm`.
* Use the Chrome menu, the 3 verticle dots, select "Add to Home screen" and follow the prompts.
* For a debug log add `?log` to the end of the url. The logged activity will appear after the remote keypad, scroll down.
   * eg. `http://hapi/remote.htm?log`
* To control the order, devices show in the display, you can use the `order` option to list the *id* of each device you want and their order. Use the report generated by the `log` option described above, to find the *id* that goes with each *name*. ~You can create multiple urls of device layouts and save them to the *Home Screen*.~ Looks like I will have to add cookies to save this option.
  * eg. `http://hapi/remote.htm?order=7,6,4,5,9`
   
### Just to be complete
There are two more url options that were used for development. They are not practicle for normal use.
* Specify a web site other than the one the html was loaded from. `?http=<a cors compliant site>`
   * eg. `http://hapi/remote.htm?http=http://hapi2`
   * eg. `http://hapi/remote.htm?log&http=http://hapi2`
* Enable some extra plain buttons for full screen control, normal, refresh etc. `?buttons`
   * eg. `http://hapi/remote.htm?buttons`
